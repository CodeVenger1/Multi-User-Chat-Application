# Server-Based Multi-User Chat Application

This repository contains the Socket_Programming folder, which is the root of a console-based C++ chat app. It demonstrates TCP sockets, a multithreaded server for concurrent client handling, and message broadcasting. The project uses <thread> & <mutex> for concurrency and CMake for cross-platform builds. Ideal for learning network programming.
